# Segment 150 Field Definitions and Element Semantics: SME/TBA Learning Note

**Segment:** 150 — Fuel Price Update Response Segment  
**Specification:** BUYPASS® Platform ATL105 Message Format Specifications, Release 2026-3  
**Source sections:** 12.35  
**Oracle:** [segment-150-rule-catalog.json](coverage/segment-150-rule-catalog.json) (3 rules)  
**Benchmark:** [Segment 100 Learning Module](../segment-100/README.md)  
**Generated:** 2026-09-28 from the rule catalog and ATL105 Chapter 13 element definitions

Segment 100 analogue: `account-number-*` (the core data carrier).

## Core Idea

Each Segment 150 field is a specific ATL105 data element with its own type, length and valid-value rules. A field is only testable when its element definition is known; a field name in a JSON payload is not evidence of conformance.

## Specification-Derived Rules (1)

| Rule | Title | Section | Element | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SEG150-R-003` | Segment Type fixed 150, Segment Length 3 digits, Terminal Identifier (echo), Decline Code (Element 26, 2 characters, indicates success or failure); all Device-sourced | 12.35 | 85,84,102,26 | SPEC_DERIVED |

## Element Definitions (ATL105 Chapter 13)

| Element | Name | Type | Max length | Representation | Valid values |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 85 | Segment Type | N | 3 bytes | Fixed length of three digits | See [Element 85 reference](#element-85-segment-type) |
| 84 | Segment Length | N | 4 bytes | Variable length of three or four digits — see [Element 84 reference](#element-84-segment-length) | See [Element 84 reference](#element-84-segment-length) |
| 102 | Terminal Identifier | AN | 22 bytes | Variable length up to 22 alphanumeric characters | See [Element 102 reference](#element-102-terminal-identifier) |
| 26 | Decline Code | AN | 2 bytes | Fixed length of two alphanumeric characters | See [Element 26 reference](#element-26-decline-code) |

### Element 85: Segment Type

- **Character type:** N · **Maximum length:** 3 bytes
- **Representation:** Fixed length of three digits
- **Purpose:** Identifies the type of segment being formatted in a Financial Transaction request, a Totals request, a Loyalty Card transaction request, Electronic Mail request, or a TransArmor PKI Encryption and Tokenization Load Request. For TransArmor PKI Encryption and Tokenization, this value indicates that the segment contains Key and Key ID information.
- **Processing rules:** Required for the TransArmor PKI Encryption and Tokenization Load Request.

### Element 84: Segment Length

- **Character type:** N · **Maximum length:** 4 bytes
- **Representation:** Variable length of three or four digits Note: Segment Length has a length of four digits in the following seven instances only: • EBT Data Segment (No. 103) • SKU Data Segment (No. 114) • Print Data Segment (No. 115) • Proprietary Data Load Segment (No. 118) • Print Data 2 Segment (No. 120) • EMV Request Data Segment (No.130) • EMV Response Data Segment (No. 131)
- **Purpose:** Identifies the length of the segment in which it appears.
- **Processing rules:** This figure is calculated using the lengths of all data elements in the segment plus all Field Separators/Product Data Field Delimiters related to those elements. (Please refer to chapter 12, “Data Segment Formats,” for additional information about specific data segments—including their composition, data element lengths, Field Separators, and Product Data Field Delimiters.) Note: Segment Length can only have a length of 4 digits when transmitting the following Data Segments. It cannot have a length of 4 digits when sending any other segment. • EBT Data Segment (No. 103) • SKU Data Segment (No. 114) • Print Data Segment (No. 115) • Proprietary Data Load Segment (No. 118) • Print Data 2 Segment (No. 120) • EMV Request Data Segment (No.130) • EMV Response Data Segment (No. 131)

### Element 102: Terminal Identifier

- **Character type:** AN · **Maximum length:** 22 bytes
- **Representation:** Variable length up to 22 alphanumeric characters
- **Purpose:** Identifies the transaction device by Device Type, State Code (ANSI® Code), BUYPASS Merchant Number, and Device Number.
- **Processing rules:** Required for all transactions and messages. The Terminal Identifier must be assigned by and set up at BUYPASS. Note: In the case of a Table Load Request, Phone Load Request, Date and Time Load Request, or Software Load Request, the field length is 13 bytes; otherwise, the field length is a maximum of 22 bytes. For the TransArmor PKI Encryption and Tokenization Load Request, the first two characters (Device Type) of this element’s value must be “++” regardless of the actual device type. For the EMV Key Load Request, the first two characters (Device Type) of this element’s value must be “+*” regardless of the actual device type.

**Valid Codes/Values**

Device Type (Pos. Nos. 1–2) Any valid 2-character Device Type assigned by BUYPASS personnel. For the TransArmor PKI Encryption and Tokenization Load Request, this element’s value must be “++” regardless of the actual device type. For the EMV Key Load Request, this element’s value must be “+*” regardless of the actual device type. State Code (Pos. Nos. 3–4) Any valid 2-character State Code (ANSI® Code). Please see Appendix D. Valid State Codes, for a list of valid ANSI® Code entries. BUYPASS Merchant Number (Starts immediately in Pos. No. 5.) Any valid 6- to 15-character BUYPASS Merchant Number assigned by BUYPASS personnel. The Device Number immediately follows the BUYPASS Merchant Number. Note: If using TransArmor, the first 6 digits of the Merchant Number are used in Error! Reference source not found.. P lease refer to the description of Element No. 2 (Account Number) for additional information. Device Number (Starts immediately after the BUYPASS Merchant Number.) Any valid 3-character Device Number assigned by BUYPASS personnel.

### Element 26: Decline Code

- **Character type:** AN · **Maximum length:** 2 bytes
- **Representation:** Fixed length of two alphanumeric characters
- **Purpose:** Identifies the reason for the decline.
- **Processing rules:** BUYPASS defines this code. For some Decline Codes, a device can be programmed to display a decline message prompting intervention by a clerk/customer. For the other Decline Codes, a device displays a decline message and completes the transaction. For a TransArmor Token Only transaction that has been declined because BUYPASS cannot retrieve the necessary token for the associated PAN, please refer to the appendix indicated below for additional information.

**Valid Codes/Values**

Any valid Decline Code. For a list of valid Decline Codes permitting clerk/customer intervention following a decline, please refer to Appendix H. Decline Codes Permitting Clerk/Customer Intervention.

## Catalog Notes

_No catalog notes are recorded against these rules._

## SME Reasoning

Ask:

1. Which element number does each field carry, and does the payload preserve it?
2. Is the value fixed-length or variable-length, and is the length measured in bytes or characters?
3. Is the field Required, Optional, or Conditional, and what triggers the condition?
4. Does the valid-value set come from Chapter 13 or from an appendix table?
5. Is any value cardholder- or key-sensitive and therefore synthetic-only in test data?

## TBA Dependency Chain

```text
element definition (Chapter 13)
  -> field position in Segment 150
  -> type / length / valid values
  -> R / O / C entry rule
  -> serialization and separator handling
```

A requirement such as "the field is valid" is untestable. A useful requirement names the element, the condition, and the observable outcome, and cites the rule ID it is derived from.

Example derived from the catalog:

```text
Segment Type fixed 150, Segment Length 3 digits, Terminal Identifier echo , Decline Code Element 26, 2 characters, indicates success or failure all Device-sourced
  -> source: ATL105 2026-3 §12.35 (SEG150-R-003)
  -> a violating payload shall fail validation citing SEG150-R-003
```

## Open Provisional Items

_No open provisional items are linked to these rules._

## Security and Test-Data Guidance

- Use synthetic values only; never copy production PANs, PINs, keys, tokens, or cryptographic material into artifacts.
- Do not treat a JSON field name as proof that the underlying element rule is satisfied.
- Keep `REVIEW_REQUIRED` rules out of `COVERED` status until the SME resolves the linked provisional item.

## Current Validator Boundary

No `Segment150PayloadValidator` exists yet. These rules are documented but not yet enforced in code.

## Review Checklist

- Is every rule traced to its source anchor (`SEG150-R-003`…)?
- Does each requirement name an element, a condition, and an observable outcome?
- Are provisional rules kept at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`?
- Is the test data synthetic and complete enough to exercise the rule?
- Is the negative case tested, not just the happy path?
